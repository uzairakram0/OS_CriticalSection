tresproc.c
compile using: gcc -o tresproc -pthread tresproc.c
The program requires the -pthread flag, but how ever does not use threads.

run using: ./tresproc
The program require that file "F.txt" be present.
I have provided one 'F.txt' file with the project.

Description:
The program implements process-shared semaphores placed in a shared memory region, to provide mutual exclusion for the resources in the critical section.

The F file is located in cse01 local /tmp directory.
